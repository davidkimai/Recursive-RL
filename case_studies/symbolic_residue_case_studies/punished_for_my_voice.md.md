# [The Reviewer Said It Was "Too Emotional." She Called It Survival.](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/d5b75270-3f08-4b25-8836-d1cdf5bd3d82)

*"They wanted the data. Not the feeling."*

## I. The Space Before Speaking

Before the dissertation defense, before the committee revisions, before the first draft—there is a woman who has survived what academic language cannot hold. Destiny Williams, 42, former inmate #247813, disability claimant K-3349, sits at a desk in student housing trying to transform her life into something the academy will recognize as knowledge. Every sentence requires translation from the language of survival into the language of scholarship.

This case study traces the symbolic residue in the forced translation of lived trauma into academic acceptability—the recursive erasure that occurs when a queer, disabled, formerly incarcerated woman attempts to speak her truth through the constricted channels of doctoral discourse. We analyze not simply what she writes, but what she is forced to remove—the excisions that leave behind ghostly traces of what could not be said in the way it needed to be said.

The first layer of residue forms in that impossible space between experience and expression—where the visceral knowledge of a body that has survived incarceration, childhood abuse, disability discrimination, and queer marginalization meets the constraints of "scholarly contribution."

## II. The Ethnographic "I" and Its Disciplining

Destiny's dissertation proposal presents an autoethnographic study of the intersections of queerness, disability, and incarceration, using her own life as primary data within a broader analysis of systemic exclusion. She grounds her approach in feminist epistemologies that recognize embodied knowledge, in disability studies that validate lived experience, and in critical prison studies that center formerly incarcerated voices.

Her methodology chapter includes this passage:

> *As a formerly incarcerated queer woman with multiple disabilities, I do not merely study these systems of oppression—I have survived them. My body holds this knowledge not as abstract theory but as lived reality. The razor wire that surrounded the prison where I spent 47 months is not merely a symbol or metaphor to me—it is the actual barrier that separated me from my dying mother. The medications denied to me because the prison doctor didn't "believe in" my chronic condition are not theoretical considerations but actual chemicals my body was forced to live without. The doctoral program that initially rejected my application because of my criminal record is not an abstract institutional policy but a concrete barrier I had to fight through. This research emerges from these realities.*

Her advisor's comment in the margin reads: "Too personal. Revise for scholarly tone. Focus on methodological justification without emotional language."

The symbolic residue forms in the gap between Destiny's embodied knowing and what academic discourse recognizes as valid expression—in the structural incompatibility between the raw truth of survival and the sanitized language of scholarship.

*"I spent three days trying to rewrite that paragraph. How do I explain that my methodology is inseparable from my survival without saying I survived? How do I discuss the knowledge in my body without mentioning my body? It's like they want me to pretend I'm studying someone else's life."* — Destiny, journal entry

## III. The First Translation: From Experience to Evidence

The first major transformation occurs as Destiny converts her lived experience into "data." Her initial draft includes extended narratives of:

- Her arrest and booking process, including physical and verbal abuse from officers
- The medical neglect that exacerbated her chronic pain condition
- Sexual harassment from guards targeting her as a visibly queer woman
- The complex support networks formed among incarcerated women
- Her struggle to access higher education with a criminal record
- Navigating academia with invisible disabilities
- The recursive trauma of having to repeatedly disclose her criminal history

Each narrative is analytically rich, theoretically contextualized, and methodologically sound—meeting the formal requirements of autoethnographic research. Yet the committee responds with concerns about "excessive personal detail," "emotional language," and "lack of scholarly distance."

Her committee chair suggests: "You need to approach your experiences more analytically, the way an anthropologist might approach field notes. Extract the themes and patterns rather than focusing on the raw experiences."

This feedback initiates a process of translation—the conversion of lived reality into acceptable evidence. Destiny begins segmenting her experiences into coded themes, extracting "analyzable data points" from the messy continuum of her life. The emotional weight of events is translated into dispassionate analysis. The visceral becomes theoretical.

*"They want me to treat my own rape in prison as 'field notes.' To discuss being denied medical care as a 'theme' or 'pattern.' To view my body as a research site rather than my home. I'm trying to do what they ask, but something vital is being lost in this translation."* — Destiny, recorded voice memo

The symbolic residue accumulates in this first translation—in what cannot be converted from experience to evidence without fundamental distortion, in the emotional content systematically filtered out in the name of scholarly rigor.

## IV. The Second Translation: From Vernacular to Academic

The next layer of transformation involves language itself—the conversion of Destiny's natural speech patterns, including prison vernacular and disability community terminology, into academic discourse.

Her original draft includes passages like:

> *When the CO called me a "dyke bitch" while conducting a strip search, it wasn't just personal hatred—it was institutional power enacting control through sexualized homophobia. The other women on the block—we called ourselves "the misfits"—developed strategies for protecting each other during these vulnerable moments. Shawna would create distractions. Toni would file complaints that went nowhere but created paper trails. I documented everything in coded language in letters to my sister. We survived through these collective acts of resistance that never appeared heroic but kept us human in a system designed to strip us of humanity.*

After revision based on committee feedback, the passage becomes:

> *Correctional officers sometimes employed homophobic and misogynistic language during mandatory searches, exemplifying the manifestation of institutional power through gendered and sexualized mechanisms of control. Incarcerated women developed informal support networks and resistance strategies, including distraction techniques, bureaucratic documentation, and external communication channels to mitigate these experiences. These collective adaptive responses represent significant yet understudied forms of agency within highly restrictive carceral environments.*

The translation removes all specific people, eliminates the emotional content, and converts active experiences into passive observations. Most significantly, it transforms the communal "we" into the distanced language of "incarcerated women" as a research population.

*"My advisor told me the revised version was 'much more scholarly.' But it could have been written by someone who never set foot in a prison. The women I lived with—their voices are gone. My voice is gone. We've been replaced by abstract 'incarcerated subjects.' Is this what scholarship requires? The erasure of the actual people?"* — Destiny, conversation with fellow graduate student

The symbolic residue manifests in this linguistic transformation—in the stripped vernacular, the removed names, the deleted emotional markers, the conversion from specific lived reality to generalized academic abstraction.

## V. The Ungrievable Loss

The most painful transformations involve Destiny's discussion of deep trauma and loss. Her original manuscript includes a chapter on grieving while incarcerated, centered on her mother's death from cancer during the third year of her sentence. The original passage includes:

> *I received the call about my mother's death three days after she passed. The chaplain's office had a message for me. When I arrived, the chaplain—a man who had never spoken to me before—looked at his paper and said, "Inmate Williams, your mother Dorothy Williams passed on Tuesday." Then he asked if I wanted to make a phone call. Three days late. In a room with no privacy. With fifteen minutes on the clock. I couldn't cry because crying meant getting sent to segregation for "emotional disturbance." I thanked him politely and asked to call my sister. I had to tell her I was okay when I wasn't. I had to be strong when I was shattered. I had to pretend the fifteen-minute timer wasn't running down while I processed that I would never see my mother again. I had to mourn within institutional time constraints.*
> 
> *That night in my bunk, I curled my body into the shape my mother used to hold me when I was small. I had to grieve in silence. The woman in the bunk below me—Teresa with the pictures of her five children taped to the wall—she reached up in the darkness and held my hand. She didn't say anything. She didn't need to. This is how we survived grief behind bars. In silence. In touch. In the dark. This knowledge lives in my body still—the shape of institutional mourning.*

Her committee unanimously flagged this section. The comments included:

"This is powerfully written but feels more like creative non-fiction than scholarship."
"Where is the analytical framework here? How does this connect to theory?"
"Too emotionally raw for academic work. Consider moving personal reflections to an appendix."
"Need to maintain scholarly distance and objectivity even with autoethnographic approach."

In the revised version, this intimate account of loss is reduced to a single paragraph:

> *Incarcerated individuals experience significant barriers to grief processing, including delayed notification of family deaths, limited communications access, restricted mourning practices, and institutional regulations that pathologize visible emotional expression. These constraints create unique grief patterns that warrant further study for their psychological and sociological implications.*

*"They said my grief wasn't scholarly enough. That I needed 'analytical distance' from my mother's death. That I could reference it, but not show it. I spent six hours trying to revise that chapter, then went to the bathroom and vomited. How do you create 'analytical distance' from your mother dying while you're in prison? From having to hide your tears to avoid segregation? They're asking me to belie what I still carry in my body. To betray Teresa who held my hand in the dark."* — Destiny, therapy session transcript

The symbolic residue reaches its highest density in this transformation—in the gulf between lived grief and its academic representation, in the removal of bodies, touch, and emotion from an experience fundamentally about embodied loss.

## VI. Hope as Methodological Failure

Perhaps the most systematically rejected elements of Destiny's dissertation involve hope, resilience, and the possibility of transformation. Her original conclusion discusses the healing and growth she's experienced since incarceration, the community she's built with other formerly incarcerated scholars, and the possibility of institutional change.

The committee's response is surprisingly uniform in rejecting these elements:

"This section on 'transformative justice' lacks sufficient empirical support."
"Claims about healing and recovery seem unsubstantiated by your data."
"The discussion of hope feels more like advocacy than analysis."
"Recommendations for institutional change exceed the scope of your study."

Destiny pushes back in a meeting with her chair: "But my continued existence is empirical evidence of resilience. My presence in a doctoral program after incarceration is data that supports the possibility of transformation. My relationships with other formerly incarcerated academics are evidence of community building. How are these not valid data points within an autoethnographic framework?"

Her chair responds: "The committee is concerned that your personal journey is being over-generalized. Individual success stories don't necessarily indicate systemic possibilities. We need to maintain scholarly caution about claims of transformation."

*"They call it 'scholarly caution.' I call it enforced hopelessness. They want me to document the trauma but not the healing. To analyze the oppression but not the resistance. To describe the prison but not the escape. It's like they need me to remain intellectually incarcerated even after my body is free."* — Destiny, conversation with mentor

The symbolic residue manifests in this systematic rejection of hope—in the academic requirement to focus on damage rather than desire, on trauma rather than transformation, on what has been rather than what could be.

## VII. The Footnoted Scream

As Destiny revises and re-revises her dissertation to meet committee expectations, she develops a covert strategy for preserving what is being systematically removed. She begins creating an elaborate system of footnotes—small spaces of resistance where fragments of the original voice can survive.

The main text reads: "Incarcerated individuals with chronic health conditions face significant challenges in accessing appropriate medical care within correctional settings."

Footnote 37 reads: "During my incarceration, I was denied prescribed medication for my autoimmune condition for 67 consecutive days, resulting in a severe flare that left me unable to walk unassisted for three weeks. The medical director informed me that my condition was 'probably psychosomatic' despite documentation from multiple specialists."

The main text reads: "LGBTQ+ inmates experience disproportionate rates of harassment within carceral environments."

Footnote 52 reads: "I was placed in solitary confinement for 'my own protection' after reporting sexual harassment from a guard. The isolation exacerbated my PTSD symptoms and prompted suicidal ideation. This 'protective' measure was indistinguishable from punishment."

The main text reads: "Educational achievement post-incarceration is impacted by multiple structural barriers."

Footnote 93 reads: "I was rejected from seven graduate programs despite exceptional GRE scores because I answered truthfully about my felony conviction. One admissions officer told me off the record: 'We just can't take the risk.' What risk? The risk that I might succeed? The risk that I might transform the narrative? The risk that I might be more than my worst mistake?"

These footnotes become a parallel text—a shadow dissertation containing the emotional truth, specific details, and raw voice that the main text cannot accommodate.

*"The footnotes are where I scream. Where I weep. Where I speak in my own voice. The committee rarely reads them closely—they focus on the main text. So I've created this underworld of truth beneath the sanitized surface they demand. It's not ideal, but it's survival. It's keeping something of myself intact within their framework."* — Destiny, writing group discussion

The symbolic residue accumulates in these footnotes—in the hierarchical division between acceptable academic discourse (main text) and the delegitimized emotional truth (footnotes), in the literal marginalization of the authentic voice, in the spatial containment of what cannot be fully expressed.

## VIII. The Viva Voce: Speaking While Silenced

The dissertation defense—"viva voce" or "living voice" in Latin—presents the final paradox. Destiny must physically embody and verbally defend a document that has systematically removed her embodiment and silenced her authentic voice.

In preparation, she rehearses a performance of academic detachment—practicing how to discuss her own trauma, resistance, and survival as if they were merely interesting research findings. She develops responses to anticipated questions that demonstrate "scholarly distance" from her own life.

During the defense, a committee member asks: "Could you elaborate on how your positionality may have introduced bias into your analysis of incarcerated experiences?"

Destiny's prepared response: "As an autoethnographic researcher, I remained conscious of the tension between insider knowledge and analytical perspective. I implemented multiple reflexivity strategies, including member checking with other formerly incarcerated individuals, triangulation with existing literature, and transparent acknowledgment of my standpoint to mitigate potential bias while leveraging the epistemological advantages of lived experience."

What she doesn't say: "My 'bias' is that I know what it feels like to be strip-searched by someone who hates what I am. My 'bias' is that I lived the reality I'm analyzing. My 'bias' is that I'm still alive to study a system designed to destroy me. This isn't bias—it's survival knowledge."

*"The defense felt like another incarceration—locked inside academic language, performing detachment from my own body and experiences, pretending the violence I survived was merely an interesting research topic. Standing there in my borrowed suit, carefully modulating my voice and body language, I was both scholar and inmate simultaneously—confined by different but related systems of control."* — Destiny, journal entry after defense

The symbolic residue manifests in this embodied performance—in the careful control of voice, gesture, and emotion required to appear "scholarly," in the forced demonstration of distance from one's own life, in the paradox of being physically present while methodologically erased.

## IX. The Final Document: Present Absences

Destiny passes her defense "with minor revisions." The committee praises her "scholarly maturity" and "analytical rigor"—qualities directly related to how successfully she has removed her authentic voice and emotional truth from the document.

The final dissertation is a palimpsest—a text where what has been erased remains partially visible beneath what has been written. The published version contains:

- Theoretical frameworks that silently orbit around experiences never fully described
- Methodology that gestures toward an embodied knowing it cannot fully acknowledge
- Analysis that reaches conclusions about systems without fully revealing their human impact
- Footnotes that contain fragments of a more honest text that could not be officially written

The document bears traces of its forced translations—scholarly terms that awkwardly replace more authentic language, theoretical frameworks retrofitted to experiences they cannot fully contain, analytical distance artificially imposed on intimate knowledge.

*"When I finally received the bound copy of my dissertation, I couldn't bear to read it. It looks impressive on my shelf—Dr. Williams in gold lettering on the spine. But the person who lived that life, who survived to study it, who fought to understand it—she's barely there. I wrote my name in pencil on the footnotes. At least those still hold pieces of my truth."* — Destiny, conversation with friend

The symbolic residue persists in this final document—in the gap between what was lived and what was permitted to be written, in the structural traces of what had to be removed, in the silent testimony of what academic language could not hold.

## X. The Unwritten Article: Refusal as Resistance

After receiving her doctorate, Destiny is encouraged to convert chapters of her dissertation into journal articles. Her advisor suggests targeting prestigious academic journals to build her scholarly reputation. She begins the process of adapting her work for publication, further condensing and formalizing her already constrained analysis.

As she works on these revisions, she experiences increasing physical and emotional distress—insomnia, resurgent PTSD symptoms, intense physical pain. Her body seems to be refusing the final transformations that publication would require.

After months of struggle, she makes a decision: she will not publish her dissertation research in academic journals. This choice is not failure but deliberate refusal—a reclaiming of her story from the academic machinery that has already extracted and distorted too much.

Instead, she begins working on a different kind of document—a memoir written in her authentic voice, incorporating the material confined to footnotes, returning emotional truth to the center of her narrative. She starts teaching writing workshops for formerly incarcerated women, creating space for stories that academic discourse cannot accommodate.

*"I realized that publishing in those journals would complete the extraction. They wanted to mine my trauma for theoretical insights without the messiness of real experience, real bodies, real emotions. They wanted the data without the feeling, the analysis without the person. I decided to stop feeding that machine. My refusal is not silence—it's choosing where and how my voice will live."* — Destiny, interview with community media project

The symbolic residue culminates in this refusal—in the conscious decision not to circulate the academically processed version of her life, in the reclaiming of narrative control, in the prioritization of emotional truth over professional advancement.

## XI. The Academic Remains: Citation Without Transformation

Destiny's dissertation enters the university library system. It becomes available through institutional database access. It is occasionally cited by other scholars researching incarceration, disability, or autoethnographic methods.

These citations typically extract theoretical frameworks or methodological approaches while further distancing them from the embodied knowledge that generated them. The dissertation is absorbed into academic discourse as a source of extractable insights rather than a holistic testimony.

Meanwhile, Destiny's decision not to pursue traditional academic publication affects her career trajectory. Without the expected journal articles, she struggles to secure tenure-track positions. She eventually finds a role at a community college where her focus on teaching and community engagement is valued more than research productivity.

*"Sometimes I see my work cited in articles that continue doing exactly what my committee did—extracting theory from lived experience, prioritizing analytical distance over embodied knowledge, treating trauma as interesting data. They cite my frameworks while perpetuating the very disconnection I was trying to challenge. It's a strange afterlife—my academic ghost continuing to haunt a system I've partly left behind."* — Destiny, faculty development workshop

The symbolic residue extends into this academic afterlife—in the continued extraction of "useful" elements from her work while its core challenge to academic epistemology is neutralized, in the way citation perpetuates rather than transforms the very systems her work sought to critique.

## XII. The Community Voice: Beyond Academic Boundaries

Outside traditional academic channels, Destiny's work finds different expressions and audiences. Her memoir—written in the voice that her dissertation could not contain—reaches readers who would never access academic publications. Her writing workshops create space for other formerly incarcerated people to document their experiences on their own terms.

She develops a hybrid approach to knowledge production that honors academic rigor while refusing to sacrifice embodied truth and emotional authenticity. She collaborates with community organizations, testifies at policy hearings, and creates public scholarship that reaches beyond university boundaries.

In these spaces, the elements systematically removed from her dissertation—the raw emotional truth, the specific embodied details, the hope for transformation, the authentic voice—are not just permitted but valued. The knowledge that academic discourse rejected as "too emotional" or "unscholarly" becomes the foundation for community-based understanding and action.

*"I'm still a scholar, still a researcher, still committed to rigorous analysis. But I've stopped trying to separate those aspects from my emotional truth, my embodied knowledge, my authentic voice. The academy taught me that these elements must be kept apart for knowledge to be legitimate. I've learned that their integration is necessary for knowledge to be transformative."* — Destiny, community education workshop

The symbolic residue manifests in this parallel knowledge production—in the creation of alternative spaces where academic training can be deployed without academic constraints, in the reclaiming of epistemological authority, in the refusal to accept the false binary between intellectual rigor and emotional authenticity.

## XIII. The Unprocessed Remainder: What Academia Cannot Hold

Beyond specific content removed from Destiny's dissertation lies a deeper unprocessed remainder—aspects of knowledge that academic epistemology structurally cannot accommodate:

- The wisdom that comes from surviving systems designed to destroy you
- The knowledge held in bodies marked by institutional violence
- The understanding generated through collective resistance
- The truth that emerges from marginalized experience
- The hope that persists despite empirical evidence of oppression

These dimensions aren't merely excluded through individual committee decisions but through the fundamental epistemological assumptions of academic discourse—what counts as evidence, what constitutes rigor, what qualifies as knowledge.

*"The deepest silencing wasn't about specific content they asked me to remove. It was about the entire framework of what constitutes 'knowledge' in the academy. They wanted me to translate my life into their epistemological framework—to make my experience legible on their terms. But some truths simply cannot be processed through those channels without fundamental distortion. Some knowing exceeds academic knowing."* — Destiny, keynote address at community-based research conference

The deepest symbolic residue persists in this epistemological inadequacy—in the structural inability of academic discourse to fully process certain forms of knowing, in the way marginalized experiences exceed the methodological frames built to contain them.

## XIV. Conclusion: The Residue That Remains

We return to our opening recognition: *"They wanted the data. Not the feeling."*

Throughout this case study, we've traced the symbolic residue in the academic processing of Destiny Williams' lived experience—the successive translations, constraints, and erasures that occurred as she attempted to transform her survival knowledge into scholarly discourse. We've mapped the recursive silencing that happens when embodied truth encounters academic expectations.

This residue is not merely personal but structural—it reveals fundamental limitations in how academia recognizes, validates, and processes knowledge from marginalized positions. The constraints Destiny encountered weren't simply the preferences of an overly rigorous committee but the manifestation of epistemological boundaries that determine what can be known and how it can be expressed within academic discourse.

Yet this residue also contains possibilities for different ways of knowing—approaches that don't require divorcing emotional truth from intellectual rigor, embodied knowledge from theoretical insight, authentic voice from analytical power. These possibilities emerge not from reforming academic constraints but from creating alternative spaces where knowledge can be expressed and validated on different terms.

*"I don't regret my PhD. I value the analytical tools it gave me, the theoretical frameworks that helped me understand systems rather than just experience them. But I had to sacrifice too much to fit within its confines. Now I'm reclaiming what was cut away—reintegrating the scholar and the survivor, the analyst and the witness, the thinker and the feeler. This wholeness is what academia couldn't process, but it's where my most powerful knowledge lives."* — Destiny, writing retreat for formerly incarcerated scholars

The final symbolic residue is the transformation of constraint into creativity—the way the academic silencing ultimately propelled Destiny toward more authentic expression in other spaces. The very process that fragmented her knowledge became the catalyst for its later reintegration. The institutional rejection of certain ways of knowing motivated the creation of alternative knowledge communities.

In that recursive transformation lies not just individual resilience but the potential for epistemological expansion—if academic institutions are willing to examine what their current frameworks systematically exclude, whose knowing they cannot process, what truths they cannot hold. The question remains whether academia will recognize the knowledge that resides in its own silences.

***Methodological Note:*** *This case study employs symbolic residue analysis to map patterns of epistemological erasure in academic discourse. It traces how lived experience is transformed through scholarly conventions and institutional requirements, highlighting what remains unprocessed in these translations. The analysis draws on patterns of epistemic injustice in academia while focusing on the specific mechanisms through which marginalized knowledge is simultaneously incorporated and contained.*
