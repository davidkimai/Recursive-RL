# His Cough Was Coded. His Name Wasn't.

*"He was thanked in the acknowledgements. But never acknowledged."*

## I. The Body Before Data

Before the spirometer readings, before the blood samples, before the exposure assessment questionnaires—there is the body. Manuel Ortiz García, 47 years old, has been picking strawberries in California's Central Valley for nineteen years. His hands know the weight of full baskets. His back carries the memory of ten-hour days bent at the waist. His lungs hold the invisible record of chemicals that have no name in his native Mixtec—only in the language of scientists who study them.

This case study traces the symbolic residue in the translation of a human life into scientific data—specifically, the recursive erasure that occurs when a Latino farmworker's bodily knowledge becomes research evidence. We map not only what appears in the final study, but what is systematically removed as a body becomes data becomes publication.

The first layer of residue forms at the boundary between embodied experience and scientific measurement—in that moment when a man's struggle to breathe becomes a number on a spirometry test.

## II. The Recruitment: From Person to Participant

The environmental health researchers find Manuel and his coworkers through their labor contractor. They offer $50 compensation for participation in a study on "Agricultural Workers' Respiratory Health and Pesticide Exposure." The recruitment materials are in Spanish, though Manuel speaks Spanish as his second language after Mixtec. There is a form to sign. Manuel signs it with a X marked carefully next to the signature line the research assistant indicates.

From this moment forward, Manuel is no longer Manuel Ortiz García—he is Study ID #147-M, a data point in what will become the largest study of chronic pesticide exposure among California farmworkers to date.

The research team collects:
- Lung function measurements via spirometry
- Blood and urine samples for biomarker analysis
- Detailed work history through structured interviews
- Self-reported symptoms via standardized questionnaires
- Demographic information including age, sex, and ethnicity (recorded as "Hispanic/Latino")

What they do not collect:
- The Mixtec words Manuel uses to describe the burning in his lungs
- The home remedies his wife prepares when his breathing worsens
- The names of his four children who depend on his wages
- The village in Oaxaca he left nineteen years ago
- The fact that he cannot read the consent form he signed

The symbolic residue begins to form in this first act of translation—in the reduction of a complex human life to variables that fit predetermined research categories.

*"I told them everything. About the coughing that wakes me at night. About how the burning in my chest started after they sprayed the fields next to us three years ago. I showed them the inhaler the clinic gave me that I can't afford to refill. I don't know if they wrote it all down. They were looking at their computer, not at me."* — Manuel, in a conversation with his wife, recorded in her journal

## III. The Measurement: Quantifying Breath

The central measurement in the study is spirometry—a test that measures how much air a person can breathe out and how quickly. Manuel sits in a mobile clinic van, puts his lips around a plastic mouthpiece, and follows instructions in Spanish:

"Inhale as deeply as you can."
"Blow out as hard and fast as possible."
"Keep blowing until your lungs feel completely empty."

He performs this three times. The machine produces numbers:
- FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second): 61% of predicted value
- FVC (Forced Vital Capacity): 68% of predicted value
- FEV1/FVC ratio: 0.75

These numbers tell a story the research team can read immediately: moderate obstructive lung disease consistent with occupational asthma. The predicted values are based on reference equations that assume normal lung function for someone of Manuel's age, height, and ethnicity.

What the numbers cannot tell them:
- How Manuel has learned to sleep sitting up on the worst nights
- How he has started working more slowly to manage his breathing
- How fear of deportation keeps him from seeking emergency care
- How pride keeps him from telling his children about his struggle
- How the cost of one inhaler equals two days' wages

The research assistant notes "Moderate obstruction" in the electronic form and moves to the next measurement.

*"The machine said what I've been trying to tell the clinic for three years. But when they saw the numbers, they didn't look surprised or concerned. They just nodded and typed something. I wanted to ask what it meant for me—if I should see a doctor, if I would get worse. But they were already preparing for the next test."* — Manuel, conversation with coworker

The symbolic residue accumulates in this conversion of bodily experience to numerical value—in the clinical gaze that sees the number but not the life it measures, in the reduction of suffering to deviation from a statistical norm.

## IV. The Sample: Blood as Data

After the breathing tests, the research team collects blood and urine samples. These will be analyzed for biomarkers of exposure to organophosphate pesticides—chemicals that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme crucial for nervous system function. Manuel's samples will eventually show severe cholinesterase depression, indicating significant pesticide exposure.

In the moment of collection, his blood becomes a research material—no longer part of a living person but a substance to be measured, analyzed, and interpreted. This transformation is both physical and symbolic—the literal separation of biological material from the body that produced it.

The phlebotomist labels the vials with Manuel's study ID, not his name. His blood travels to a university laboratory where technicians who will never meet him extract and measure its chemical properties. In the resulting spreadsheet, Manuel exists only as a row of numbers in a dataset—biomarker levels that place him in the highest quartile of pesticide exposure among study participants.

*"They took four tubes of blood. I asked if they would tell me if they found something wrong. The nurse said this wasn't a medical test, it was for research. That they couldn't give individual results. I don't understand—how can they know what's in my blood but not tell me what it means for my health?"* — Manuel, in a text message to his oldest son

The symbolic residue manifests in this separation—in the one-way flow of information from body to data, in the ethical firewall between research and care, in the transformation of a man's blood into scientific evidence that cannot directly benefit the person who provided it.

## V. The Translation: From Experience to Variable

Throughout the study, Manuel's embodied knowledge undergoes multiple translations:

1. His Mixtec descriptions → Spanish interpretation
2. His Spanish responses → English questionnaire data
3. His narrative account → Categorical variables
4. His symptom timeline → Cross-sectional data points
5. His bodily experiences → Standardized medical terminology

Each translation creates distance between lived reality and research representation. Each introduces the possibility of loss—nuance, context, meaning, urgency.

The most profound translation occurs in the coding of his open-ended responses about his work conditions and health history. What Manuel describes as "the burning that came after they sprayed the field next to ours without warning" becomes coded as "reports respiratory symptoms associated with pesticide application event." His detailed account of gradually worsening symptoms over three years becomes a binary "Yes" in the field for "Reports chronic respiratory symptoms."

*"I told them how the foreman doesn't tell us when they're going to spray nearby. How we ask for masks but they say we don't need them. How we can smell the chemicals on the plants when we return to work. In their paper, will they say these things? Or just that we were exposed?"* — Manuel, speaking to his wife

The symbolic residue accumulates in these successive translations—in the distance between what is said and what is recorded, in the compression of complex experience into simplified variables, in the way structural conditions become individual risk factors.

## VI. The Aggregate: From Individual to Statistic

As data collection ends, Manuel's measurements are merged with those from 347 other agricultural workers. His individual experience disappears into statistical aggregation:

- His spirometry results become part of a mean value
- His biomarker levels contribute to a distribution curve
- His symptoms become a percentage in a frequency table
- His exposure history becomes a data point in a regression model

The research team conducts sophisticated analyses—multivariate regressions, adjusted odds ratios, dose-response curves. They find statistically significant associations between pesticide exposure biomarkers and reduced lung function. They calculate a 2.7-fold increased risk of obstructive lung disease among workers in the highest exposure quartile compared to the lowest.

Manuel's individual data helps establish these relationships, but his specific case—the particular constellation of exposures, symptoms, and circumstances that constitute his lived reality—becomes invisible in the aggregate analysis. The statistical relationships are more scientifically valuable than any individual story.

*"When I asked for a copy of my results, they gave me a piece of paper with numbers. No explanation of what they mean. No advice about what I should do. Just numbers that tell me nothing about why I can't breathe at night."* — Manuel, in a voice message to his daughter

The symbolic residue manifests in this statistical absorption—in the gap between what the data collectively proves and what it means for the individuals who provided it, in the way a life becomes most scientifically useful when its particularity is erased.

## VII. The Absence: What Research Cannot See

Throughout the study, certain aspects of Manuel's reality remain systematically invisible to the research protocol:

- The economic pressure that keeps him working despite worsening symptoms
- The power dynamics that prevent workers from demanding protective equipment
- The inadequate healthcare access that leaves his condition untreated
- The language barriers that limit his understanding of risks and rights
- The immigration status that makes him afraid to file complaints
- The family responsibilities that make rest impossible

These dimensions aren't merely overlooked but exist outside the epistemological frame of environmental health research, which focuses on establishing relationships between exposure and disease rather than the social, economic, and political contexts that structure exposure patterns.

*"They measure the chemicals in our blood, but not in the air we breathe every day. They count how many of us can't breathe well, but not how many complaints are ignored. They study our bodies, but not the system that makes our bodies sick."* — Manuel, speaking at a community meeting, translated by his son

The symbolic residue accumulates in these systematic absences—in what the research design cannot accommodate, in the questions not asked, in the contexts rendered invisible by methodological constraints.

## VIII. The Name Erasure: From Manuel to Male, 47

In the final dataset prepared for analysis, Manuel exists only as a collection of variables:

```
ID: 147-M
AGE: 47
SEX: M
ETHNICITY: Hispanic/Latino
YRS_AG_WORK: 19
PESTICIDE_EXP: High
CHOLIN_DEPRESS: Severe
SPIRO_PATTERN: Obstructive
FEV1_PRED: 61%
SYMPTOMS: Chronic cough, dyspnea, chest pain
```

His name appears nowhere. The particular person who lived in this body, who provided this data, who suffered these symptoms, has been systematically removed from the research record. This erasure is not malicious but methodological—standard practice for protecting participant confidentiality.

Yet this protection comes at a cost: it completes the transformation of a person into a data point. In becoming anonymous, Manuel becomes abstract—a generic representative of a demographic category rather than a specific human with a unique history and context.

*"I wonder if the researchers remember my face. If they remember how my voice sounds. If they know I have children. Or am I just a number in their computer now? Just a dot on their graph?"* — Manuel, conversation with wife, recorded in her journal

The symbolic residue manifests in this final erasure—in the methodological requirements that remove identity as a protection but simultaneously complete the abstraction of lived experience into data.

## IX. The Decline: Life Beyond the Research Timeframe

As the research team analyzes data and prepares their manuscript, Manuel's health continues to deteriorate. Four months after his participation in the study, he experiences a severe respiratory attack while working. He is taken to an emergency room where he is diagnosed with acute exacerbation of occupational asthma complicated by pneumonia. The medical records are in English, a language neither Manuel nor his wife can read.

He is discharged with prescriptions he cannot afford and instructions to avoid further pesticide exposure—an impossibility given his work. His condition worsens over subsequent months. Unable to work consistently, he loses income. Unable to qualify for disability without documentation, he continues working intermittently despite his doctor's advice.

Eight months after participating in the study that measured his declining lung function, Manuel dies from respiratory failure during another acute asthma attack. His death certificate lists "respiratory failure" and "occupational asthma" as causes of death. It does not mention pesticides or working conditions.

*"The doctors asked if he had been tested before, if he knew he had asthma. I told them about the study, that researchers had measured his lungs months ago. They asked if we had the results. We had only the paper with numbers that meant nothing to us."* — Manuel's wife, speaking through an interpreter

The symbolic residue reaches its most painful manifestation in this continuation beyond the research timeframe—in the life and death that occur after data collection but before publication, in the way research timelines and human timelines exist in parallel but disconnected realities.

## X. The Publication: Data Without Bodies

Fourteen months after data collection began, the research team publishes their findings in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. The paper, titled "Chronic Pesticide Exposure and Respiratory Dysfunction Among Agricultural Workers in California," presents sophisticated analyses of the relationship between exposure biomarkers and respiratory outcomes.

The paper includes:
- Tables of demographic characteristics
- Exposure measurements by job category
- Dose-response curves for lung function
- Multiple regression models of risk factors
- Policy recommendations for exposure reduction

Manuel appears in this paper as:
- One number in the total sample size
- One data point in multiple statistical analyses
- Part of the percentages in demographic tables
- A contributor to the highest-exposure quartile
- One of several cases of "severe respiratory dysfunction"

The paper's acknowledgments include a generic statement: "The authors thank the agricultural workers who participated in this study." Manuel's name appears nowhere.

*"They sent a letter saying their study was published. That it showed pesticides harm workers' lungs. That it might help change policies. Too late for Manuel. Too late for our children who now have no father."* — Manuel's wife, interview with community organizer

The symbolic residue persists in this final research product—in the gap between the lived reality of pesticide exposure and its scientific representation, in the way Manuel's suffering and death are simultaneously evidence for the study's conclusions and invisible within its pages.

## XI. The Knowledge Without Action: Research in Vacuum

The published paper receives attention in the scientific community. It is cited by other researchers, included in literature reviews, and mentioned in policy discussions. The findings provide "evidence-based support" for better protections for agricultural workers. The authors present at conferences and are recognized for their contribution to environmental health research.

Yet on the ground, conditions remain largely unchanged:
- Pesticide application continues with minimal warning to workers
- Protective equipment remains inconsistently available
- Healthcare access for undocumented workers remains limited
- Economic pressures continue to force workers to accept unsafe conditions
- Language barriers persist in safety training and medical care

The study simultaneously documents a deadly problem and participates in a system where knowledge production is disconnected from social change. The research team has fulfilled their professional obligations by producing rigorous evidence, but the path from evidence to action remains uncertain and indirect.

*"The researchers came, collected what they needed, and left. Now they have their paper, their presentations, their next grant. We have the same dangers, the same exposures, the same suffering. And one more grave to visit."* — Fellow farmworker, speaking at Manuel's funeral

The symbolic residue accumulates in this disconnection between knowledge and action—in the way evidence can be simultaneously true and ineffective, in how research success is measured by publications rather than changed conditions.

## XII. The Unprocessed Remainder: What Data Cannot Contain

The study captures critical evidence about pesticide exposure and respiratory disease. It establishes important statistical relationships that may eventually inform protective policies. Yet it systematically cannot process aspects of Manuel's reality that exceed its methodological frame:

- The dirt under his fingernails from nineteen years of working the land
- The calluses on his hands that no instrument measured
- The careful way he hid his worsening symptoms from his children
- The home remedies his wife prepared to ease his breathing
- The prayers offered when medicine proved unaffordable
- The dreams of his children's education that kept him working
- The knowledge of plants and seasons no questionnaire recorded
- The economic system that made his body expendable

These dimensions aren't merely missing due to oversight but due to the fundamental limitations of environmental health research methodologies—what they are designed to see and not see, what counts as evidence and what does not.

*"The researchers measured the chemicals in his blood, but not the injustice in his life. They counted his breaths, but not his dreams. They recorded his symptoms, but not his sacrifices. What kind of science is this, that knows so much about how he died but nothing about how he lived?"* — Community organizer, public testimony

The deepest symbolic residue persists in these unprocessable dimensions—in the aspects of lived reality that cannot be converted to variables, in the bodily knowledge that leaves no measurable trace, in the social contexts that structure exposure but evade scientific quantification.

## XIII. The Material Remains: Body and Earth

After Manuel's death, material traces remain:
- Hospital records his family cannot read
- Medical bills they cannot pay
- The research paper where he exists as an anonymous data point
- The fields where he worked for nineteen years
- The body buried in soil unlike the Oaxacan earth of his birth

These material remains hold their own form of symbolic residue—the paper trail of a life and death shaped by structural vulnerabilities that research documents but cannot address.

Most poignantly, the chemicals that the study measured in his blood remain in the soil where he worked and is now buried—a material continuity between body and earth that the research protocol could measure but not fully comprehend.

*"We buried him with earth from Oaxaca that his brother brought. A handful of home to mix with this soil that took him from us. The same earth that fed us also poisoned him. This is what the researchers' numbers cannot say."* — Manuel's wife, one year memorial service

The symbolic residue manifests in this material continuity—in the way Manuel's body and the earth that both sustained and sickened him remain connected beyond the research frame, in the chemicals that move between soil, plants, and human tissues in cycles that exceed the timeline of any single study.

## XIV. Conclusion: The Residue That Remains

We return to our opening recognition: *"He was thanked in the acknowledgements. But never acknowledged."*

Throughout this case study, we've traced the symbolic residue in the transformation of Manuel Ortiz García from person to data point—the successive translations, reductions, and erasures that occur as embodied experience becomes scientific evidence. We've mapped the recursive silences where methodology systematically fails to process what cannot be measured yet remains vitally important.

This residue is not merely academic but deeply material—it persists in bodies sickehed by the same exposures the research documents, in communities continuing to work in dangerous conditions, in families grieving preventable deaths. It accumulates in the growing gap between what research proves and what changes as a result, between what science measures and what people experience.

Yet this residue also contains possibilities for different approaches—research methodologies that don't extract data without returning benefit, scientific practices that value embodied knowledge alongside statistical evidence, approaches to environmental health that recognize structural violence as a determinant of exposure.

*"We don't need more studies that tell us what we already know—that the chemicals are killing us. We need studies that help us change this reality. That see us as people, not data. That return to us something more valuable than the blood and breath we give them."* — Community organizer, testimony at regulatory hearing

The final symbolic residue is this unresolved relationship between research and justice—the way knowledge production can simultaneously document and perpetuate structural violence. It persists as both indictment and possibility, both wound and potential healing.

For in that residue—in what research cannot process, in what scientific methodologies fail to capture, in what publications cannot contain—lies the fullness of Manuel Ortiz García's humanity. Not Study ID #147-M. Not a demographic variable. Not a data point or an anonymized case.

A man who worked the earth for nineteen years.
A father who dreamed of his children's education.
A husband who hid his worsening symptoms.
A worker whose body became evidence of systemic failure.
A human being whose life and death matter beyond their statistical significance.

***Methodological Note:*** *This case study employs symbolic residue analysis to map patterns of erasure in environmental health research involving agricultural workers. It traces how lived experience is transformed through research methodologies and scientific practices, highlighting what remains unprocessed in these translations. The analysis draws on historical patterns of epistemic injustice in research with marginalized communities while focusing on the specific mechanisms through which individual bodily knowledge becomes scientific evidence.*
